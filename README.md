# Spacestagram

Spacestragram is an online image collection app that retrieves images from the Mars Rovers using NASA's open API. Browse through real photos taken by the actual Mars Rovers during their missions on Mars. If you see any images that stand out to you, you can like that image and it will be stored for you so you can always see it!
